# DevOps Apprenticeship - KSB Cheatsheet
## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/JMcK4529/DevOps_SkillChecks.git`
2. (Optional) Install some HTML extension in VSCode.
(I would recommend [HTML Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=george-alisson.html-preview-vscode))

## Usage
### `occupation_duties.html`
This page has a table of all the duties that we (as DevOps apprentices) are meant to fulfil while on placement, along with the associated KSBs.  
Hover over a KSB to see its description. This is automatically filled from the corresponding section in `KSB.md`.
### `retro-diary-template.md`
Here's a simple markdown file that I have been using as a template for Retro Diary entries.  
I also use the [Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) and [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) extensions in VSCode.  
They help me to keep an eye on my layout, and convert files to PDF for submission, respectively.
